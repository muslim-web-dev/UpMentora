## 🎯 Phase 1: Mentor Acquisition Campaign

### 🛠 Goal

Acquire **at least 400 mentors**, with a combination of real mentors and admin-managed accounts, to ensure every subject has adequate coverage when students start arriving.

### 📌 Strategy

#### 1. **Facebook Ad Campaign – Targeting Mentors**

- **Target Audience:**
  - University students
  - Freelance educators
  - Recent graduates
  - Subject matter experts
  - Country: Global (prioritized by English-speaking & high-education regions)

- **Ad Objectives:**
  - Drive traffic to the mentor registration page
  - Highlight the benefits of becoming a mentor:
    - Set your own schedule
    - Get paid hourly
    - Teach from anywhere

- **Campaign Duration:**
  - 2–4 weeks

- **Expected Outcome:**
  - Acquire **200+ verified mentors**
  - Capture all mentor data (name, email, subject expertise, availability, etc.)

#### 2. **Admin-Created Mentor Accounts (Mock Profiles)**

To ensure wide subject availability in the early stages:

- Create **200 mock/fake mentor accounts**
  - Each account covers a unique subject/topic
  - Always appear as “Available”
  - Used to keep the platform **visually active and functional**
- These accounts:
  - Will be used for real sessions (manually fulfilled by admin/hired tutors)
  - Help ensure no student ever finds an “empty” category
  - Will gradually be phased out as real mentor supply increases

## 📌 Summary

Focusing your mentorship marketing around **Bangladesh’s academic calendar** allows you to:
- Precisely target your ads
- Provide relevant value at the right time
- Avoid wasting ad budget outside exam peaks

By aligning mentor availability with exam seasons, your platform will feel **timely, trustworthy, and highly relevant** to your audience.

---

## 🤝 Manual Matching & Session Fulfillment (Early Stage)

Until the mentor ecosystem becomes self-sustaining:

### 👥 Admin Intervention

- When a student **books a session** with an unavailable mentor:
  - Admin is **notified automatically**
  - Admin reaches out to the mentor to **confirm availability**
  - If the mentor is unresponsive, admin **reassigns** to another available mentor or **fulfills manually**

### 🧑‍💻 Manual Session Fulfillment

- A small **internal tutoring team** or **freelancers** will handle requests when:
  - A real mentor is unavailable
  - A session is booked through a mock account

- **Objective**: Ensure **every booking leads to a successful session**, even if backend operations are manual in the early stage.
